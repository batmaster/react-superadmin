# React SuperAdmin Project Rules

## Project Structure
This is a monorepo with pnpm workspaces containing:
- `packages/core`: Core framework with TypeScript, React hooks, contexts, and utilities
- `packages/web`: Web admin interface using Vite, React, Tailwind CSS

## Development Commands
- Use `pnpm dev` to start development (runs web package)
- Use `pnpm build` to build both packages
- Use `pnpm build:core` or `pnpm build:web` for individual packages

## Key Patterns
- Components use PascalCase naming (e.g., DataTable, ResourceForm)
- Hooks use camelCase with 'use' prefix (e.g., useAuth, useFilters)
- Core package exports reusable framework code
- Web package imports from core and provides admin interface
- Both packages use TypeScript with strict mode

## File Organization
- Core package: components/, contexts/, hooks/, types/, utils/
- Web package: components/crud/, components/forms/, components/layout/, components/ui/
- Use relative imports within packages, package imports between packages

## Technology Stack
- React 18+ with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Vite for web package build tool
- pnpm as package manager with workspace support
